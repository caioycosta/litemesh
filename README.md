# LiteMesh

LiteMesh is an upcoming lightweight and simplified library for creating distributed systems with ease. It aims to provide a seamless communication and interaction framework for multiple instances of an application, enabling messaging, service discovery, and querying in a distributed environment.

## Project Goals

LiteMesh strives to achieve the following objectives:

- **Simplified Distributed Systems**: Enable developers to easily build distributed systems, even without extensive knowledge of distributed systems concepts.
- **Effortless Communication**: Facilitate messaging between instances of an application using unicast, anycast, or broadcast methods, even in cases where a direct route is unavailable.
- **Flexible Connectivity**: Support communication over various means, including TCP, shared files, and databases, allowing seamless integration into diverse infrastructure setups.
- **Library for Server/Node Components**: Use the server/node component library to seamlessly integrate LiteMesh into your existing application's infrastructure.
- **Client Library**: Utilize the client library to query and interact with the distributed system through any available means, providing flexibility and accessibility.
- **Service Discovery**: Enable automatic discovery of services and capabilities within the distributed system graph, enhancing dynamic interaction and integration.
- **Querying Capabilities**: Provide the ability to query the state of specific nodes or services within the distributed system, enabling efficient distributed monitoring, troubleshooting, and decision-making.

## Project Status

LiteMesh is currently under development and is not yet ready for production use. We are actively working on implementing the core features and ensuring stability and performance. As we make progress, we will update the repository with more information, documentation, and examples.
